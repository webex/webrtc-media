### Building

If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the
project after some code changes, state them here:

```shell
yarn build
```

### Testing

```shell
yarn test
```

### Testing in debug mode

```shell
yarn test:debug
```

1.	After the above command, open up http://localhost:9876/debug.html in browser and do inspect element. (Note - HTTP & not HTTPS)
1.	Here, the test files would be available in sources tab, where debuggers can be set and refresh the page to run tests again.
1.	It also looks out for changes. So, whenever the test file changes, the test cases re-run in terminal and latest changes reflect in debug.html upon page refresh.

yarn run test:integration
```

### Integration Testing with Sauce Labs

```
2. Make sure your `SAUCE_USERNAME` and `SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables are set in ```.env``` file.

3. Run the below command in the terminal.
```shell
SAUCE=true yarn run test:integration
```
4. Sauce labs link in the results or Open your Sauce labs and filter test with your name and see the test case.
